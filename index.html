  <h1>World of Life and Death</h1>
  <div id="target"> </div>
  <p>
    This is a grid world composed of cells, and in each cell, there can either be a Human (blue), Zombie (Red), Plant
    (Green), or nothing (White). Plants generate energy and constantlyspread very quickly, while Humans and Zombies
    constantly
    lose energy and need to eat to survive and spread themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humans can eat Plants, and only make offsprings when there's plenty of energy stored. They can attack Zombies and
    deal damage equal to their own stored energy. Unfortunately, there's a zombie apocalypse happening, and Humans have
    a chance to suddenly mutate into Zombies without prior warnings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Zombies also eat Plants, but that only let them live a little bit longer since they decay much faster than Humans, and can't
    make offsprings. Instead, when engaged in combat with Humans, if they have more energy, the Humans will be defeated
    and converted into Zombies.

    Pressing 'Start' will let the initial populations of the 3 species to start moving and acting based on these
    premises. Pressing 'Step' during that will speed up the process, but using it while the world is on pause allow you
    to see how the cells change in each interation.
